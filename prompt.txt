Create a modern and scalable admin dashboard for a hotel service management system using the following frontend stack:

Tech Stack:
- React (with Vite and TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- ShadCN UI (based on Radix UI + Tailwind)
- TanStack Table v8 (for advanced table components with pagination, sorting, and filtering)
- React Hook Form + Zod for form management and validation
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state and API data fetching
- Zustand for simple and scalable global state management (auth, UI state, etc.)

The dashboard should include:
- Sidebar navigation: Manage rooms, bookings, customers, staff, revenue, and settings.
- Topbar with user info and notifications.
- Content area with data grids (TanStack Table), cards, and forms.
- Light/Dark mode toggle support.
- Responsive design for tablet/desktop.

The project should have:
- A clean folder structure (components, hooks, pages, stores, utils, etc.)
- Authentication state (mock or real)
- Example pages: Room List, Booking List (with table and filters), Customer Detail (with form)

Use best practices for TypeScript, Tailwind, and component reusability. The project should be production-ready and easy to extend.
Make sure no errors when done.
